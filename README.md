## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Penn State with a Ph.D. in Computer Science. My work combines AI, NLP, and Psychometrics to better understand people and machines.

Some projects I've worked on:

### At Penn State
CPIG: A Multiagent System using generative AI for creativity assessment [[Code](https://github.com/Beaty-Lab/creativity-item-generation)] [[Paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3810/paper5.pdf)]

More coming soon!

### For my Ph.D.
Question generation using psychometric prompting and generative AI [[Code](https://github.com/Advancing-Machine-Human-Reasoning-Lab/gpt3-item-generation)] [[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.bea-1.34.pdf)]

Modeling human psychometrics using transformers [[Code](https://github.com/Advancing-Machine-Human-Reasoning-Lab/transformer-psychometrics)] [[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.starsem-1.pdf#page=26)]

Understanding negation processing in LLMs using Developmental Psych [[Code](https://github.com/Advancing-Machine-Human-Reasoning-Lab/negation-processing-ACL-2022)] [[Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-short.60.pdf)]

Predicting word acquisition norms using machine learning [[Code](https://github.com/Advancing-Machine-Human-Reasoning-Lab/modeling-acquisition-norms)] [[Paper](https://journals.flvc.org/FLAIRS/article/view/128334)]

### Side projects
